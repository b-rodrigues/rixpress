#' Read output of a derivation
#' @description Reads the output of derivations in the current session,

#' @details When `derivation_name` points to a single R object,

#'   If it's a Python object and `{reticulate}` is available,
#'   `reticulate::py_load_object()` is used. In case
#'   the derivation is pointing to several outputs (which can
#'   happen when building a Quarto document for example) or
#'   neither `readRDS()` nor `reticulate::py_load_object()`
#'   successfully read the object, the path to the object is
#'   returned instead.
#' @param derivation_name Character, the name of the derivation.
#' @param which_log Character, defaults to NULL. If NULL the most recent

#' Load output of a derivation

#' @description Loads the output of derivations in the parent frame of the
#'   current session, returns a path if reading directly is not possible.
#' @details When `derivation_name` points to a single R object, it gets loaded
#'   in the current session using `assign(..., envir = parent.frame())`, which
#'   corresponds to the global environment in a regular interactive session. If
#'   you're trying to load a Python object and `{reticulate}` is available,
#'   `reticulate::py_load_object()` is used and then the object gets loaded into
#'   the golbal environment. In case the derivation is pointing to several
#'   outputs (which can happen when building a Quarto document for example) or
#'   loading fails, the path to the object is returned instead.
#' @param derivation_name Character, the name of the derivation.
#' @param which_log Character, defaults to NULL. If NULL the most recent
#'   build log is used. If a string is provided, it's used as a
#'   regular expression to match against available log files.
#' @return Nothing, this function has the side effect of loading objects into
#'   the parent frame.
