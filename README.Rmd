`rixpress` streamlines creation of *micropipelines* (small-to-medium,
single–machine analytic pipelines) by expressing a pipeline in idiomatic R while
delegating build orchestration, dependency management, and multi-language
execution to the 'Nix' build system. It is inspired by the user experience of
the `{targets}` package and builds on the `{rix}` package to obtain fully
reproducible development/runtime environments.

Key ideas:

- Define pipeline *derivations* with concise `rxp_*()` helper functions.
- Seamlessly mix R, Python, Julia, Quarto / Markdown steps.
- Reuse hermetic environments (pinned system + language dependencies) defined
  via `{rix}` and a `default.nix`.
- Visualize and inspect the DAG; selectively read, load, or copy outputs.
- Export/import build artifacts to speed up CI or share results.

Here is what a basic pipeline looks like:

``` r
library(rixpress)

list(
  rxp_r_file(
    mtcars,
    'mtcars.csv',
    \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_am,
    filter(mtcars, am == 1)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_head,
    head(mtcars_am)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_tail,
    tail(mtcars_head)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_mpg,
    select(mtcars_tail, mpg)
  ),

  rxp_qmd(
    page,
    "page.qmd"
  )
) |>
  rxp_populate()
```

## Motivation

Reproducibility involves two intertwined concerns: (1) the *environment* (system
libraries, compilers, language interpreters, packages) and (2) the *execution
graph* of analytic steps with their inputs and outputs. There are many tools to
address both of these concerns, but orchestrating them is not always easy.

Another developing trend, in my opinion, is that data science is becoming
increasingly **polyglot**: teams rarely restrict themselves to a single
language. Python dominates machine learning, R excels at statistical modeling
and visualization, and Julia offers high-performance numerics with a syntax that
feels familiar to both communities. Analysts and researchers often need to
combine strengths from all three, moving data and results fluidly across tools.

This trend makes a unifying foundation essential. Without it, people waste time
stitching together environments, dealing with dependency conflicts, or
struggling to reproduce results on different machines. **Nix** provides that
foundation by declaratively describing environments which include system
libraries, compilers, interpreters, and packages in a way that is reproducible
down to exact versions and build instructions.

The `{rix}` package brings this power into the R ecosystem. It makes it easy to
generate declarative, date-pinned Nix expressions that work consistently across
systems. This expressions can then be used to build reproducible development
environments that include programming languages, packages and other tools.
`{rixpress}` addresses the next part, the execution graph. With a concise R API,
it lets users describe analytic steps, inputs, and outputs, while delegating
execution to Nix for guaranteed determinism.

Together, this means data scientists can orchestrate polyglot pipelines that
combine R, Python, and Julia seamlessly, with environments and workflows that
are portable, reproducible, and future-proof.

## Feature Highlights

- Uniform `rxp_*()` constructors for files, R functions, Python / Julia code,
  and Quarto documents.
- Cross-language object exchange via serialization helpers.
- Pipelines as compositions of pure functions: derivations are content-addressed and cached in the Nix store.
- DAG visualization (e.g. `rxp_ggdag()`, `rxp_visnetwork()`).
- Target introspection (`rxp_read()`, `rxp_load()`, `rxp_copy()`, `rxp_trace()`).
- Artifact export/import for CI acceleration.

## Examples

Here is what a basic pipeline looks like:

```r
library(rixpress)

list(
  rxp_r_file(
    mtcars,
    'mtcars.csv',
    \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_am,
    filter(mtcars, am == 1)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_head,
    head(mtcars_am)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_tail,
    tail(mtcars_head)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_mpg,
    select(mtcars_tail, mpg)
  ),

  rxp_qmd(
    page,
    "page.qmd"
  )
) |>
  rxp_populate()
```

Running `rxp_populate()` generates a `pipeline.nix` file, which contains
the build instructions for all derivations and final outputs expressed
as Nix code. You can define derivations that run Python or Julia code,
and objects can be exchanged between R and Python by using `rxp_py2r()`
and `rxp_r2py()`, or by serializing to a common format such as JSON. By
default, calling `rxp_populate()` also builds the pipeline, but it’s
possible to only generate the `pipeline.nix` file and build the pipeline
later using:

``` r
rxp_make()
```

The build process assumes the presence of a `default.nix` file that
defines the computational environment the pipeline runs in; this file
can be generated with the {rix} package. The `default.nix` typically
defines an environment with R and required R packages (and optionally
Python/Julia and their packages), Quarto, and any necessary system-level
dependencies pinned to a specific date to ensure reproducibility.

In the example above, the first derivation reads `mtcars.csv` (in the
example it’s pipe-separated, i.e. a `.psv` file). Each output (for
example, `mtcars`, `mtcars_am`, `mtcars_head`, `mtcars_tail`,
`mtcars_mpg`, `page`) is built by Nix within the environment defined by
`default.nix`. Concretely, {rix} makes using Nix as a package manager
easier for R users, and {rixpress} makes it easy to use Nix as a build
automation tool.

And this is what a polyglot pipeline, using both R and Python, looks like:

```r
library(rixpress)

list(
  rxp_py_file(
    name = mtcars_pl,
    path = "data/mtcars.csv",
    read_function = "lambda x: polars.read_csv(x, separator='|')"
  ),

  rxp_py(
    name = mtcars_pl_am,
    expr = "mtcars_pl.filter(polars.col('am') == 1)",
    user_functions = "functions.py",
    encoder = "serialize_to_json",
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_head,
    expr = my_head(mtcars_pl_am),
    user_functions = "functions.R",
    decoder = "jsonlite::fromJSON"
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_mpg,
    expr = dplyr::select(mtcars_head, mpg)
  )
) |>
  rxp_populate(project_path = ".", build = FALSE)
```

Because the pipeline is built using Nix, outputs are stored in the Nix
store under `/nix/store/`. To make working with these outputs easier,
`{rixpress}` provides several helper functions:

- `rxp_read("mtcars_mpg")` — read the content of `mtcars_mpg` into R
  (the return value depends on the derivation type: an R object, a file
  path, etc.);
- `rxp_load("mtcars_mpg")` — load objects from the result into the
  global environment;
- `rxp_copy("page")` — copy outputs (e.g. a generated document) from the
  Nix store into the current working directory so you can open or
  inspect them there.

Python objects will be converted into their equivalent R objects if
`{reticulate}` is available in the environment. For complex outputs such as
documents (for example the Quarto document `page` above), `rxp_read("page")`
returns the output file path; you can then open it with `browseURL()` or copy it
into your working directory with `rxp_copy()`.

`{rixpress}` is flexible; please consult the examples repository for
many different patterns and complete demos:

<https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos/tree/master>

## Getting started

While `{rixpress}` is a regular R package, there is little point in using it
without having Nix installed. If you are not familiar with Nix, I recommend you
first start by checking out `{rix}`, which will teach you how to use Nix to set
up reproducible development environments for your R projects!

We recommend you check out the following vignettes to get started:

- [Introductory concepts](https://docs.ropensci.org/rixpress/articles/intro-concepts.html)
- [Core rixpress Functions and Usage](https://docs.ropensci.org/rixpress/articles/core-functions.html)
- [Tutorial](https://docs.ropensci.org/rixpress/articles/tutorial.html)


## Visualization

It is possible to visually inspect the pipeline:

```r
# ggdag-based static plot
rxp_ggdag()
```
<figure>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rixpress/refs/heads/main/dag.png" alt="DAG" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">

DAG
</figcaption>

</figure>

```r
# Interactive network (visNetwork)
rxp_visnetwork()
```

To create an artifact suitable for CI, use:

```r
rxp_dag_for_ci()
```

This will export the directed acyclic graph of the pipeline as a `dot` file,
making it possible to visualize in CI (using
[`stacked-dag`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stacked-dag) for example).

## Exporting / Importing Artifacts

Speed up continuous integration or move a cache between machines:

```r
# Export build products
rxp_export_artifacts()

# Import elsewhere before building
rxp_import_artifacts()
```
