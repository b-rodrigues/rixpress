# rixpress: Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with Nix

[![R-hub v2](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/actions/workflows/rhub.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/actions/workflows/rhub.yaml/)

This R packages provides a framework for building multilanguage reproducible
analytical pipelines by leveraging Nix’s build automation capabilities. It is
heavily inspired by the R package `{targets}`. It builds upon the `{rix}`
package, which provides helper function to define reproducible development
environments as code using Nix ensuring the pipeline runs in a fully
reproducible Nix-managed environment. `{rixpress}` only requires users to write
a pipeline using familiar R code.

For example, this R script defines a list of *derivations* defined by functions
prefixed with `rxp_*()`, which is then passed to `rixpress()`:

``` r
library(rixpress)

list(
  rxp_r_file(
    mtcars,
    'mtcars.csv',
    \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_am,
    filter(mtcars, am == 1)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_head,
    head(mtcars_am)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_tail,
    tail(mtcars_head)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    mtcars_mpg,
    select(mtcars_tail, mpg)
  ),

  rxp_quarto(
    page,
    "page.qmd"
  )
) |>
  rixpress()
```

Running `rixpress()` generates a `pipeline.nix` file, which contains all the
build instructions of all the derivations and final outputs as Nix code. It is
possible to define derivations that run Python code as well, and objects can be
passed to and from R or Python by using `rxp_py2r()` and `ryp_r2py()`. By
default, calling `rixpress()` also builds the pipeline, but it's possible to
only generate the `pipeline.nix` file and then build the pipeline at a later
stage using:

    rxp_make()

The build process assumes the presence of a `default.nix` file which defines the
computational environment the pipeline runs in; this `default.nix` file can be
generated by using the `{rix}` package. This `default.nix` defines an
environment with R, R packages (and also Python and Python packages if needed),
Quarto, and all required system-level dependencies pinned to a specific date to
ensure reproducibility.

In the example above, the first derivation loads `mtcars.csv` (it actually
should be a `.psv` file, since the data is separated by pipes –`|`… why? just
because–). Each output (e.g., `mtcars`, `mtcars_am`, `mtcars_head`,
`mtcars_tail`, `mtcars_mpg`, `page`) is built by Nix within the environment
defined by the `default.nix` file. Concretely, `{rix}` made using Nix as a
package manager easier for R users, `{rixpress}` makes it now easy to use Nix as
a build automation tool!

When you run `rixpress()`, a folder called `_rixpress/` gets also generated
which contains a file with a JSON representation of the pipeline’s DAG (Directed
Acyclic Graph). You can visualize the pipeline using `plot_dag()`:

``` r
rxp_ggdag()
```

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">DAG</figcaption>
</figure>

Because the pipeline is built using Nix, the outputs all get stored in the
so-called Nix store under `/nix/store`. It can be annoying to retrieve objects
from the Nix store so `{rixpress}` contains several helper functions:

- `rxp_read("mtcars_mpg")` reads `mtcars_mpg` into memory;
- `rxp_load("mtcars_mpg")` loads them into the global environment.

For complex outputs such as documents, (for example the Quarto document defined
above, called `page`), `rxp_read("page")` returns its file path, which you can
open with `browseURL("path/to/page")`, or you can copy the outputs from the
`/nix/store/` into the current worknig directory using `rxp_copy("page")`, and
read it from there.

You can export the cache into a file and easily import it on another machine (or
on CI) to avoid having to rebuild everything from scratch using
`export_nix_archive()` and `import_nix_archive()` respectively.

`rixpress()` is very flexible; please consult [this
repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos/tree/master) which
contains many different examples you can take inspiration from.

## Installation

### rix

`{rixpress}` builds on `{rix}`, so we highly recommend you start by learning and
using `{rix}` before trying your hand at `{rixpress}`. By learning how to use
`{rix}`, you'll learn more about Nix, how to install and use it, and will then
be ready to use `{rixpress}`!

### Installing rixpress

Since there's little point in installing `{rixpress}` if you don't use Nix, the
ideal way to install `{rixpress}` is instead to use `{rix}` to set up a
reproducible environment that includes `{rixpress}` and the other required
dependencies for your project. Take a look at the [introductory concepts
vignette](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rixpress/articles/a-intro_concepts.html)
and [basic usage
vignette](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rixpress/articles/b-basic_pipeline.html)
to get started!

That being said, `{rixpress}` is a regular R package, so you can install it from
GitHub directly (while it's not on CRAN):

``` r
# Install remotes if you don’t have it
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

# Install the package from GitHub
remotes::install_github("b-rodrigues/rixpress")
```
