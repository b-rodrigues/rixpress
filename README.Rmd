# rixpress: Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with Nix

This R packages provides a framework for building multilanguage reproducible
analytical pipelines by leverarging Nix's build automation capabilities. It is
heavily inspired by the R package `{targets}`. It builds upon the `{rix}`
package, which provides helper function to define reproducible development
environments as code using Nix ensuring the pipeline runs in a fully
reproducible Nix-managed environment. `{rixpress}` only requires users to write
a pipeline using familiar R code.

For example this R script defines some *derivations* (`d0`, ..., `d4` and `doc`)
which are then passed to `rixpress()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rixpress)

d0 <- rxp_file(mtcars, 'mtcars.csv', \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|")))
d1 <- rxp_r(mtcars_am, filter(mtcars, am == 1))
d2 <- rxp_r(mtcars_head, head(mtcars_am))
d3 <- rxp_r(mtcars_tail, tail(mtcars_head))
d4 <- rxp_r(mtcars_mpg, select(mtcars_tail, mpg))
doc <- rxp_quarto(page, "page.qmd")

rxp_list <- list(d0, d1, d2, d3, d4, doc)

rixpress(rxp_list)
```

Running `rixpress(rxp_list)` generates a `pipeline.nix` file, which contains all
the build instructions of all the derivations and final outputs as Nix code. It
is possible to define derivation that runs Python code as well. To build the
pipeline run:

```
rxp_make()
```

The build process assumes the presence of a `default.nix` file which defines the
computational environment the pipeline runs in; this `default.nix` file can be
generated by using the `{rix}` package. This `default.nix` defines an
environment with R, R packages, Quarto, and all required system-level
dependencies pinned to a specific date to ensure reproducibility.

In the example above, the first derivation loads `mtcars.csv` (it actually
should be a `.psv` file, since the data is separated by pipes --`|`... why? just
because--). Each output (e.g., `mtcars`, `mtcars_am`, `mtcars_head`,
`mtcars_tail`, `mtcars_mpg`, `page`) is built by Nix within the environment
defined by the `default.nix` file. Concretely, `{rix}` made using Nix as a
package manager easier for R users, `{rixpress}` makes it now easy to use Nix as
a build automation tool!

When you run `rixpress(rxp_list)`, a folder called `_rixpress/` gets also generated
which contains a file with a JSON representation of the pipeline’s DAG (Directed Acyclic
Graph). You can visualize the pipeline using `plot_dag()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_dag()
```

Because the pipeline is built using Nix, the outputs all get store in the
so-called Nix store under `/nix/store`. It can be annoying to retrieve objects
from the Nix store so `{rixpress}` contains several helper functions:

- `rxp_read("mtcars_mpg")` reads `mtcars_mpg` into memory;
- `rxp_load("mtcars_mpg")` loads them into the global environment.

For complex outputs such as documents, (for example the Quarto document defined
above, called `page`), `rxp_read("page")` returns its file path, which you can
open with `browseURL("path/to/page")`, or you can copy the outputs from the
`/nix/store/` into the current worknig directory using `rxp_copy("page")`, and
read it from there.

You can export the cache into a file and easily import it on another machine (or
on CI) to avoid having to rebuild everything from scratch using
`export_nix_archive()` and `import_nix_archive()` respectively.

## Purpose

The goal is to create data analysis pipelines that are:

- **Fully Reproducible:** Work the same way across machines and over time.
- **Multi-Language:** Allow steps in R, Python (planned), or other languages supported by Nix.
- **Inspired by targets:** Mimic its dependency tracking and task orchestration, enhanced by Nix’s deterministic builds.

By combining Nix’s reproducibility with a targets-like structure, you can
rebuild every step of your analysis—data processing, modeling, reporting—exactly
as intended, even years later or on different systems (as long as the sources
stay available or the systems are supported by Nix of course).

## How It Works

### Environment Setup with `default.nix`

- The `rix` package creates a `default.nix` file specifying your software
  environment (e.g., R version, packages). This environment can be used
  traditional interactive data analysis.
- `{rixpress}` generates a `pipeline.nix` which builds a (potentially) polyglott
  data science project using Nix as the build automation tool.
- The `default.nix` generated by `{rix}` is used to provide the right environment
  to the pipeline.

### Pipeline Definition
- Define steps (derivations) in a `pipeline.nix` file, which can use R or
  other languages.
- Each derivation produces outputs like datasets or reports.

### Dependency Graph
- A `dag.json` file maps out the relationships between derivations.
- R scripts process this JSON to add correct dependency loading to `pipeline.nix`.

### Building the Pipeline
- Run `rxp_make()` to execute the pipeline, storing outputs in the Nix store
  (e.g., `/nix/store/...`).
- Easily recover the outputs in your current R session using `rxp_read()` and
  `rxp_lead()`.

## Key Advantages of Using Nix

- **Complete Reproducibility:** Pins all dependencies to exact versions.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Unlike `targets`, it’s not limited to R.
- **Isolation:** Each step runs in a sandbox, avoiding system interference.
- **Portability:** Share your Nix files, and anyone with Nix can rebuild your work.

## Inspiration from `targets`

This package borrows from `targets`:

- **Dependency Tracking:** Ensures steps only rerun when inputs change.
- **Modularity:** Breaks workflows into reusable steps.
- **Automation:** Executes tasks in the right order.

Nix extends these ideas beyond R into a cross-language, reproducible framework.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

#### Install Nix
tbd

### Install from GitHub

To install this package directly from GitHub, use the `remotes` R package:

```r
# Install remotes if you don’t have it
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

# Install the package from GitHub
remotes::install_github("b-rodrigues/rixpress")
```

## Usage Example

### Define Your Pipeline in R

```r
# Create derivations
d1 <- rxp_r(mtcars_am, filter(mtcars, am == 1))
d2 <- rxp_r(mtcars_head, head(mtcars_am))

# Collect into a list
rxp_list <- list(d1, d2)

# Save or process further (e.g., generate pipeline.nix and dag.json)
```

### Build the Pipeline

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rxp_make()
```

This builds all derivations, producing outputs in the Nix store.
