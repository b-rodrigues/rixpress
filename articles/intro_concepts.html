<p>This vignette will introduce some jargon and walk you through setting
up a simple pipeline using <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/" class="external-link">rixpress</a>. It is useful, but
not mandatory, to understand the concepts laid out in this vignette; we
recommend you go through it, but if you don’t get everything at first,
don’t worry. Try building a simple pipeline by going through the next
vignette <code>vignette("basic-usage")</code>.</p>

</h2>
<p>In Nix jargon, a derivation <em>is a specification for running an
executable on precisely defined input files to repeatably produce output
files at uniquely determined file system paths.</em> (<a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.25/language/derivations" class="external-link">source</a>)</p>
<p>In simpler terms, a derivation is a recipe with precisely defined
inputs, steps, and a fixed output, meaning that for exactly the same
inputs and exactly the same build steps, exactly the same output is
produced. This is important to understand because to always build
exactly the same output, several measures must be taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>A derivation must have all of its inputs declared explicitly.</li>
<li>Inputs include software dependencies as well as configuration flags
or environment variables; in other words, anything necessary for a build
process.</li>
<li>To ensure the exact same output is always built, the build process
occurs in an <em>hermetic</em> sandbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next sections of this document explain these three points in more
detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="derivations">Derivations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#derivations"></a>
</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a <em>simple</em> Nix expression:</p>
<pre><code>let
 pkgs = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/rstats-on-nix/nixpkgs/archive/2025-04-11.tar.gz") {};

in

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "filtered_mtcars";
  buildInputs = [ pkgs.gawk ];
  dontUnpack = true;
  src = ./mtcars.csv;
  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out
    awk -F',' 'NR==1 || $9=="1" { print }' $src &gt; $out/filtered.csv
  '';
}</code></pre>
<p>I will not go into details: the only thing that matters is that this
uses <code>awk</code>, a common unix data processing tool, to keep the
rows of the <code>mtcars.csv</code> file where its 9th column (the
<code>am</code> column) equals 1. As you can see, a lot of boilerplate
code must be written to perform this simple action. However, this is
entirely, and completely, reproducible: the dependencies are declared
and pinned to a dated branch of our <code>rstats-on-nix/nixpkgs</code>
fork, and the only think that could make this pipeline fail (well, it’s
a bit of a stretch to call this a <em>pipeline</em>) is if the
<code>mtcars.csv</code> file is not shared with it.</p>
<p>I could then add another step that uses <code>filtered.csv</code> as
an input and continue to process it. If we label the above code as
<code>f</code> and a subsequent chunk of Nix code to <code>g</code>,
then adding another step would essentially result in the following
computation: <code>mtcars |&gt; f |&gt; g</code>.</p>
<p>The goal of <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/" class="external-link">rixpress</a> is to help you write pipelines
like <code>mtcars |&gt; f |&gt; g</code> without needing to learn Nix,
but still benefit from its features.</p>
<p>Nix builds <code>filtered.csv</code> in two steps: it first generates
a <em>derivation</em> from this expression, and only then builds it. For
our purposes, I will be referring to the code as the one above as
<em>derivation</em>, instead of expression, this to avoid confusion with
the concept of <em>expression</em> in R.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="dependencies-of-derivations">Dependencies of derivations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dependencies-of-derivations"></a>
</h2>
<p>Nix requires dependencies of any derivation to be explicitely listed
and also managed by Nix itself. If you’re building your output and it
requires, say, Quarto, then Quarto must be explicitly listed as an
input, even if you already have Quarto installed on your system.</p>
<p>The same goes for environment variables; for example, R users may
have to set the variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to make R aware of where
the Java runtime is installed. However, if Java is required for a
derivation, setting the variable <code>JAVA_HOME</code> outside of the
sandbox does not help; it must be set explicitly within the sandbox.
This also means that if you need to access an API to download some data,
it will not work because no connection to the internet is allowed from
within the build sandbox.</p>
<p>This may seem very restrictive, but if you think about it, it makes
sense if your goal is to achieve complete reproducibility. Indeed, say
that you need to use a function <code>f()</code> to access an API to get
data for your analysis: what guarantee do you have that running
<code>f()</code> today will yield the same result as running
<code>f()</code> in six months? One year? Will this API even still be
online? For reproducibility purposes, you should obtain the data from
this API, then version and/or archive it, and continue using this data
for your analysis (and share it with potential reproducers of your
study).</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="the-nix-store-and-hermetic-builds">The Nix store and hermetic builds<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-nix-store-and-hermetic-builds"></a>
</h2>
<p>When building derivations, their outputs are saved into the so-called
<em>Nix store</em>. Typically located at <code>/nix/store</code>, this
folder contains all the software and build artifacts produced by Nix.
Suppose you write a derivation that computes the tail of a file named
<code>mtcars.csv</code>. Once the derivation is built, its output would
be stored at a path similar to
<code>/nix/store/81k4s9q652jlka0c36khpscnmr8wk7jb-mtcars_tail</code>,
where the long cryptographic hash uniquely identifies the build output.
This hash is computed based on the content of the derivation along with
all its inputs and dependencies, thereby ensuring that the build is
fully reproducible. As a result, building the same derivation on two
different machines will yield the same cryptographic hash. This is
exactly like in mathematics, if you consider the function
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mo>:=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x):= x^2</annotation></semantics></math>
then writing
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(2)</annotation></semantics></math>
or
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mn>4</mn><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4</annotation></semantics></math>
is the same.</p>
<p>This mechanism is what makes it possible to import and export build
artifacts between pipelines to avoid having to rebuild everything from
scratch on different machines or on continuous integration platforms.
<a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/" class="external-link">rixpress</a> has two functions that allow this, called
<code><a href="../reference/export_nix_archive.html">export_nix_archive()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/import_nix_archive.html">import_nix_archive()</a></code>.</p>
<p>To ensure that building derivations always produce exactly the same
outputs, builds must occur in an isolated environment, often referred to
as a sandbox. This approach, known as a hermetic build process, ensures
that the build is unaffected by external factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="summary-and-conclusion">Summary and conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary-and-conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>As explained at the start of this vignette, Nix will generate a
derivation from a Nix expression with a process called instantiation.
Writing a reproducible pipeline with Nix would mean having to write a
very long and complex Nix expression. <a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/" class="external-link">rixpress</a> takes care
of this for you.</p>
<p>When instantiating an expression, Nix processes your declarations,
resolves all the inputs (including source files, build scripts, and
external dependencies), and computes a unique cryptographic hash. This
hash, derived from both the contents of your derivation and its entire
dependency graph, forms part of the derivation’s identity. Essentially,
it ensures that even the smallest change in your inputs will lead to a
distinct derivation, safeguarding reproducibility. To avoid confusion
with the concept of expression in R, we will be referring to Nix
expressions as <em>derivations</em>.</p>
<p>Once instantiated, derivations can be built. During the build
process, Nix constructs an isolated, hermetic environment where only the
explicitly declared dependencies are available. By doing so, the build
is entirely deterministic, meaning that the exact same inputs always
produce the same outputs, regardless of the machine or environment. This
isolation not only improves reliability but also facilitates debugging
and maintenance, as any external variability is removed from the
equation.</p>
<p>After a successful build, Nix stores the build output in the Nix
store (typically located at <code>/nix/store</code>). For instance, if
you build a derivation that processes the <code>mtcars.csv</code> file,
the resultant output might be saved under a unique path such as
<code>/nix/store/81k4s9q652jlka0c36khpscnmr8wk7jb-mtcars_tail</code>.
Here, the long cryptographic hash is a direct reflection of the
derivation’s inputs and build process.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/" class="external-link">rixpress</a> abstracts all of this and makes it easy for R
users to use the power of Nix to build reproducible analytical
pipelines.</p>
<p>Now that you are familiar with basic Nix concepts, let’s move on to
the next vignette to set up our first, basic, pipeline by going to the
<code>vignette("basic-usage")</code> vignette.</p>
