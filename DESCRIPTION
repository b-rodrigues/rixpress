Title: Build Reproducible Analytical Pipelines With Nix
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R:
    person("Bruno", "Rodrigues", , "bruno@brodrigues.co", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Streamlines the creation of reproducible analytical pipelines using
  `default.nix` expressions generated via `{rix}` for reproducibility. Define
  derivations in R or Python, chain them into a composition of pure functions
  and build the resulting pipeline using `Nix` as the underlying end-to-end build
  tool. Functions to plot a DAG representation of the pipeline are included,
  as well as functions to load and inspect intermediary results for interactive
  analysis. User experience heavily inspired by the `{targets}` package.
