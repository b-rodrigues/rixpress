This vignette will introduce some jargon and walk you through setting up a
simple pipeline using `{rixpress}`. It is useful, but not mandatory, to
understand the concepts laid out in this vignette; we recommend you go through
it, but if you don't get everything at first, don't worry. Try building a simple
pipeline by going through the next vignette `vignette("b-basic-usage")` and come
back to this vignette afterwards, and things should be clearer!

## Definitions

In Nix jargon, a derivation *is a specification for running an executable on
precisely defined input files to repeatably produce output files at uniquely
determined file system paths.*
([source](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.25/language/derivations))

In simpler terms, a derivation is a recipe with precisely defined inputs, steps,
and a fixed output, meaning that for exactly the same inputs and exactly the
same build steps, exactly the same output is produced. This is important to
understand because to always build exactly the same output, several measures
must be taken:

- A derivation must have all of its inputs declared explicitly.
- Inputs include software dependencies as well as configuration flags or
  environment variables; in other words, anything necessary for a build process.
- To ensure the exact same output is always built, the build process occurs in
  an *hermetic* sandbox.

The next sections of this document explain these three points in more detail.

## Derivations

Here is an example of a *simple* Nix expression:

```
let
 pkgs = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/rstats-on-nix/nixpkgs/archive/2025-04-11.tar.gz") {};

in

pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "filtered_mtcars";
  buildInputs = [ pkgs.gawk ];
  dontUnpack = true;
  src = ./mtcars.csv;
  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out
    awk -F',' 'NR==1 || $9=="1" { print }' $src > $out/filtered.csv
  '';
}
```

I will not go into details: the only thing that matters is that this uses `awk`,
a common unix data processing tool, to keep the rows of the `mtcars.csv` file
where its 9th column (the `am` column) equals 1. As you can see, a lot of
boilerplate code must be written to perform this simple action. However, this is
entirely, and completely, reproducible: the dependencies are declared and pinned
to a dated branch of our `rstats-on-nix/nixpkgs` fork, and the only think that
could make this pipeline fail (well, it's a bit of a stretch to call this a
*pipeline*) is if the `mtcars.csv` file is not shared with it.

I could then add another step that uses `filtered.csv` as an input and continue
to process it. If we label the above code as `f` and a subsequent chunk of Nix
code to `g`, then adding another step would essentially result in the following
computation: `mtcars |> f |> g`.

The goal of `{rixpress}` is to help you write pipelines like `mtcars |> f |> g`
without needing to learn Nix, but still benefit from its features.

Nix builds `filtered.csv` in two steps: it first generates a *derivation* from
this expression, and only then builds it. For our purposes, I will be referring
to the code as the one above as *derivation*, instead of expression, this to
avoid confusion with the concept of *expression* in R.

## Dependencies of derivations

Nix requires dependencies of any derivation to be explicitely listed and also
managed by Nix itself. If you're building your output and it requires, say,
Quarto, then Quarto must be explicitly listed as an input, even if you already
have Quarto installed on your system. The same goes for Quarto's dependencies,
and all the dependencies of dependencies of Quarto, all the way down to the
common ancestor of all packages. With Nix, to run a linear regression with R,
you first need to build the universe.

In Nix terms, this complete set of packages and their dependencies are what its
author, Eelco Dolstra, refers to as *component closures*:

> The idea is to always deploy component closures: if we deploy a component,
> then we must also deploy its dependencies, their dependencies, and so on. That
> is, we must always deploy a set of components that is closed under the
> ''depends on'' relation. Since closures are selfcontained, they are the units
> of complete software deployment. After all, if a set of components is not
> closed, it is not safe to deploy, since using them might cause other
> components to be referenced that are missing on the target system.

(*Nix: A Safe and Policy-Free System for Software Deployment*, Dolstra et al., 2004).

The figure below, from the same paper illustrates this idea:

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">

</figure>

In the figure, `subversion` depends on `openssl` which itself depends on
`glibc`. So if you write a derivation that is supposed to build a data frame
that is the result of a filter applied to `mtcars`, then this derivation
requires:

- An input file, say, `mtcars.csv`;
- R and potentially R packages say `{dplyr}`;
- R's and R packages dependencies;
- the dependencies of the dependencies (all the way down).

All need to be managed by Nix, because if one of these dependencies is "outside"
this component closure and only available on your machine, then the pipeline
only *works on your machine*!

Nix distinguishes between different types of dependencies (`buildInputs`,
`nativeBuildInputs`, `propagatedBuildInputs`, `propagatedNativeBuildInputs`) but
we can skip this concept which is only relevant for packaging upstream software,
not to define our pipelines. But if you're curious, read
[this](https://gist.github.com/b-rodrigues/c677b59126d05d43347ed9623ddd5b0c).

## The Nix store and hermetic builds

When building derivations, their outputs are saved into the so-called *Nix
store*. Typically located at `/nix/store/`, this folder contains all the
software and build artifacts produced by Nix. Suppose you write a derivation
that computes the tail of a file named `mtcars.csv`. Once the derivation is
built, its output would be stored at a path similar to
`/nix/store/81k4s9q652jlka0c36khpscnmr8wk7jb-mtcars_tail`, where the long
cryptographic hash uniquely identifies the build output. This hash is computed
based on the content of the derivation along with all its inputs and
dependencies, thereby ensuring that the build is fully reproducible. As a
result, building the same derivation on two different machines will yield the
same cryptographic hash, and you can replace the built artifact with the
derivation that generates it one-to-one. This is exactly like in mathematics; if
you consider the function $f(x):= x^2$ then writing $f(2)$ or $4$ is the same.

This mechanism is what makes it possible to import and export build artifacts
between pipelines to avoid having to rebuild everything from scratch on
different machines or on continuous integration platforms. `{rixpress}` has two
functions that allow this, called `export_nix_archive()` and
`import_nix_archive()`.

To ensure that building derivations always produces exactly the same outputs,
builds must occur in an isolated environment, often referred to as a sandbox.
This approach, known as a hermetic build process, ensures that the build is
unaffected by external factors.

The same goes for environment variables; for example, R users may have to set
the variable `JAVA_HOME` to make R aware of where the Java runtime is installed.
However, if Java is required for a derivation, setting the variable `JAVA_HOME`
outside of the sandbox does not help; it must be set explicitly within the
sandbox. This also means that if you need to access an API to download some
data, it will not work because no connection to the internet is allowed from
within the build sandbox.

This may seem very restrictive, but if you think about it, it makes sense if
your goal is to achieve complete reproducibility. Indeed, say that you need to
use a function `f()` to access an API to get data for your analysis: what
guarantee do you have that running `f()` today will yield the same result as
running `f()` in six months? One year? Will this API even still be online? For
reproducibility purposes, you should obtain the data from this API, then version
and/or archive it, and continue using this data for your analysis (and share it
with potential reproducers of your study).

## Summary and conclusion

As explained at the start of this vignette, Nix will generate a derivation from
a Nix expression with a process called instantiation. Writing a reproducible
pipeline with Nix would mean having to write a very long and complex Nix
expression. `{rixpress}` takes care of this for you.

When instantiating an expression, Nix processes your declarations, resolves all
the inputs (including source files, build scripts, and external dependencies),
and computes a unique cryptographic hash. This hash, derived from both the
contents of your derivation and its entire dependency graph, forms part of the
derivation's identity. Essentially, it ensures that even the smallest change in
your inputs will lead to a distinct derivation, safeguarding reproducibility. To
avoid confusion with the concept of expression in R, we will be referring to Nix
expressions as *derivations*.

Once instantiated, derivations can be built. During the build process, Nix
constructs an isolated, hermetic environment where only the explicitly declared
dependencies are available. By doing so, the build is entirely deterministic,
meaning that the exact same inputs always produce the same outputs, regardless
of the machine or environment. This isolation not only improves reliability but
also facilitates debugging and maintenance, as any external variability is
removed from the equation.

After a successful build, Nix stores the build output in the Nix store
(typically located at `/nix/store/`). For instance, if you build a derivation
that processes the `mtcars.csv` file, the resultant output might be saved under
a unique path such as `/nix/store/81k4s9q652jlka0c36khpscnmr8wk7jb-mtcars_tail`.
The cryptographic hash is computed by taking into consideration the derivation's
input and build process. If *anything* changes, the hash will be different; this
goes as far as if you change the separator in the `mtcars.csv` data set from `,`
to `|`, then the resulting `mtcars_tail` object, while looking exactly the same
to us, will be different from the perspective of Nix, because on of its inputs
was different.

The lesson here, is that Nix is quite a complex tool, because it solves quite a
complex problem. `{rixpress}` (and `{rix}`) are packages that aim to make Nix
more accessible to users of the R programming language.

Now that you are familiar with basic Nix concepts, let's move on to the next
vignette to set up our first, basic, pipeline by going to the
`vignette("b-basic-usage")` vignette.
