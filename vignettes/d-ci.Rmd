This vignette demonstrates how to build a polyglot pipeline and assumes you've
read `vignette("c-polyglot")`.

You can find all the code of this example
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos/tree/master/python_r). The
built Quarto document can be viewed
[here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rixpress_demos/python_r/index.html) (the
pipeline in this vignette is a slightly simplified version).

## Running pipelines on GitHub Actions

Running pipelines on GitHub Actions is quite easy. First, run the `rxp_ga()`
function in your project's root. This will generate a GitHub Actions `.yaml`
file to run the pipeline on each push or pull request. Here are the different
steps that happen:

- if previous runs artifacts exist, those get restored to avoid recomputing them
  using `rixpress::import_nix_archive()`;
- required software gets installed;
- the execution environment gets generated and built;
- the `rstats-on-nix` cache gets configured to decrease build times, see this
  [documentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/articles/b1-setting-up-and-using-rix-on-linux-and-windows.html#using-the-determinate-systems-installer)
  (ignore the part about installing Nix);
- the pipeline gets generated (and build, depending on whether or not you set
  `build` to `FALSE` or not in the `rixpress()` call);
- the dag gets printed;
- the pipeline gets built: if you set `build` to `TRUE` previously, the build
  process gets skipped anyway;
- the build artifacts and their paths get printed;
- the build artifacts get archived for reuse using
  `rixpress::export_nix_archive()` for subsequent runs and are pushed to the
  `rixpress-runs` branch.

Let me explain how it is possible to view the DAG in CI. In an interactive
session, you only need to call `plot_dag()` to see a graphical representation of
the pipeline. But in CI, since there's no graphical interface, so you need to
use a tool that allows to represent the pipeline in text mode. One such tool is
the `stacked-dag` package for the Haskell programming language. It takes an
`igraph` object as a `.dot` file, and returns a textual representation of the
DAG. So there's a step in the `.yaml` file used to run the pipeline in CI
that does exactly this:

```
- name: Check DAG if dag.dot exists and show it if yes
  run: |
    if [ -f dag.dot ]; then
      nix-shell --quiet -p haskellPackages.stacked-dag --run "stacked-dag dot _rixpress/dag.dot"
    else
      echo "dag.dot not found"
    fi
```

As you can see, `stacked-dag` shows the file under the `_rixpress/dag.dot`
folder. When calling `rxp_ga()`, the `dag_for_ci()` function is called
automatically to generate the `.dot` file and put it in the right spot.

Here is what this looks like:
