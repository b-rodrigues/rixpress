This vignette demonstrates how to build a polyglot pipeline and assumes you've
read `vignette("b-basic-usage")`.

For a video version of this vignette, CHECK OUT THIS UPCOMING VIDEO ON YOUTUBE

You can find all the code of this example
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos/tree/master/python_r). The
built Quarto document can be viewed
[here](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/rixpress_demos/python_r/index.html) (the
pipeline in this vignette is a slightly simplified version).

## Analysing the mtcars dataset using R and Python

`{rixpress}` makes it easy to write polyglot or multilingual, data science
pipelines with derivation that run R or Python code. This vignette explains
how you can easily set up such a pipeline.

First, call `rxp_init()` which will generate two files, `gen-env.R` and
`gen-pipeline.R`. In `gen-env.R`, we define the execution environment:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rix)

rix(
  date = "2025-03-31",
  r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "igraph", "reticulate", "quarto"),
  git_pkgs = list(
    package_name = "rixpress",
    repo_url = "https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress",
    commit = "HEAD"
  ),
  py_pkgs = list(
    py_version = "3.12",
    py_pkgs = c("pandas", "polars", "pyarrow")
  ),
  ide = "none",
  project_path = ".",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

Notice the `py_pkgs` argument to `rix()`: this will install Python and the
listed Python packages in that environment. You'll notice that we add
`{reticulate}` to the list of R packages to install as well; this is only needed
to convert data between R and Python: Python build steps are executed in a
standard Python shell without the need to use `{reticulate}`.

If you want to work on a machine without R nor `{rix}` but with Nix already
installed, we provide a way to bootstrap a complete environment using this call:

```
nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rix/main/inst/extdata/default.nix)"
```

This will drop you into a shell with R and `{rix}` available. Simply start R by
typing `R` and then `source("gen-env.R")` to generate the required
`default.nix`. Then, quit R and the shell (CTRL-D or `quit()` in R, `exit` in
the terminal) and then build the environment defined by the freshly generated
`default.nix` by typing `nix-build`.

Now is time to build the pipeline. Here is a simple example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rixpress)
library(igraph)

list(
  rxp_py_file(
    name = mtcars_pl,
    path = 'data/mtcars.csv',
    read_function = "lambda x: polars.read_csv(x, separator='|')"
  ),

  rxp_py(
    # reticulate doesn't support polars DFs yet, so need to convert
    # first to pandas DF
    name = mtcars_pl_am,
    py_expr = "mtcars_pl.filter(polars.col('am') == 1).to_pandas()"
  ),

  rxp_py2r(
    name = mtcars_am,
    expr = mtcars_pl_am
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_head,
    expr = my_head(mtcars_am),
    additional_files = "functions.R"
  ),

  rxp_r2py(
    name = mtcars_head_py,
    expr = mtcars_head
  ),

  rxp_py(
    name = mtcars_tail_py,
    py_expr = 'mtcars_head_py.tail()'
  ),

  rxp_py2r(
    name = mtcars_tail,
    expr = mtcars_tail_py
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_mpg,
    expr = dplyr::select(mtcars_tail, mpg)
  ),

  rxp_quarto(
    name = page,
    qmd_file = "my_doc/page.qmd",
    additional_files = c("my_doc/content.qmd", "my_doc/images")
  )
) |>
  rixpress(project_path = ".")
```

As you can see, it starts off by reading in some data using the Python polars
package, and then converts it to an R data frame for further manipulation,
converts it back to a Python data frame and back to R. You'll notice that at
some point the *head* of the data is computed using a user-defined function
called `my_head()`. User-defined functions should all go into a script called
`functions.R` or `functions.py` and derivation that use them need to be aware of
them by setting the `additional_files` argument (if derivation need further
files to be available, these can be put there as well. A main difference between
`rxp_py()` and `rxp_r()` is that Python code should be passed as a string, and
not as an expression. Also, you'll notice that I had to use `polars.read_csv()`
instead of the more common `pl.read_csv()`. This is because by default Python
package get imported using a simple statement `import polars`. If you want to
change this to `import polars as pl` (`import pandas as pd` and so on), then you
can use the `adjust_imports()` function. For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
adjust_imports("import polars", "import polars as pl")
```

`adjust_imports()` is sometimes mandatory, for example if you want to import a
package's submodule:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
adjust_imports("import pillow", "from PIL import Image")
```

The package is called `pillow`, so `{rixpress}` will import write the statement
as `import pillow`, but this will simply not work. So in this case
`adjust_imports()` must be used.

## Building a Quarto document

The last derivation builds a Quarto document using `rxp_quarto()`. Here again,
the `additional_files` argument is used to make the derivation aware of required
files to build the document. Here is what the source of the document looks like:

````text

---
title: "Loading derivations outputs in a quarto doc"
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
    toc: true
---

![Meme](images/meme.png)

Use `rxp_read()` to show object in the document:

```
rixpress::rxp_read("mtcars_head")
```

```
rixpress::rxp_read("mtcars_tail")
```

```
rixpress::rxp_read("mtcars_mpg")
```

{{< include content.qmd >}}

```
rixpress::rxp_read("mtcars_tail_py")
```

````

Just like in an interactive session, `rxp_read()` is used to retrieve the
objects from the store. See how I refer to the other document `content.qmd` and
the image `meme.png`.

If you want to add further arguments to the Quarto command line tool, you can
use the `args` argument:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rxp_quarto(
  name = page,
  qmd_file = "my_doc/page.qmd",
  additional_files = c("my_doc/content.qmd", "my_doc/images"),
  args = "--to typst"
)
```

and don't forget to add `typst` to the list of system packages in the call to
`rix()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rix(
  date = "2025-03-31",
  r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "igraph", "reticulate", "quarto"),
  system_pkgs = "typst",
  git_pkgs = list(...
```

In the future, other languages could be added to `{rixpress}`, notably Julia.
