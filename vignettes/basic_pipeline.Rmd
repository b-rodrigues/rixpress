This vignette demonstrates how to set up a simple pipeline, and assumes you've
read `vignette("a-introductory-concepts")`.

## Analysing the mtcars dataset

`{rixpress}` comes with many functions to help you write derivations; these
typically start with the string `rxp_` and all have roughly the same structure.
The first step in any pipeline is to get some data in. To include data in a
`{rixpress}` pipeline, you should use `rxp_r_file()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d0 <- rxp_r_file(
  name = mtcars,
  path = 'data/mtcars.csv',
  read_function = \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
)
```

`rxp_r_file()` uses an R function of only one argument which should be the path
to the file to be read. In this case, for illustration purposes, we assume the
columns in the `mtcars.csv` file are separated by the `|` symbol. So we use an
anonymous function to set the correct separator and create a temporary function
of only one argument to read the path, `'data/mtcars.csv'`. You should be aware
that doing this means that the `mtcars.csv` file **will be copied** to the Nix
store. This is essential to how Nix works and cannot be avoided.

Also notice that `rxp_r_file()` is quite flexible: it'll work with any function
to read in a type of file.

Once that data is read, we need to start manipulating it. To generate a similar
derivation to the one described in `vignette("a-introductory-concepts")`, but
using R and `{dplyr}` to process the data instead of `awk`, one would write:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d1 <- rxp_r(
  name = filtered_mtcars,
  expr = dplyr::filter(mtcars, am == 1)
)
```

This should be very familiar to users of the `{targets}` package: just like with
the `tar_target()` function, you just need to give a name to the derivation and
then command to generate it. That's it: all the required Nix code gets generated
by `{rixpress}`.

To continue transforming the data, you only need to define a new derivation:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d2 <- rxp_r(
  name = mtcars_mpg,
  expr = dplyr::select(filtered_mtcars, mpg)
)
```

Let's stop here for now, and try to build the pipeline. For this, define a list
of derivations:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
derivs <- list(d0, d1, d2)
```

and pass it to the `rixpress()` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rixpress(derivs)
```

To avoid having to write so much code, you can instead directly define
the list and pass it to `rixpress()` using  `|>`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rixpress)

list(
  rxp_r_file(
    name = mtcars,
    path = 'data/mtcars.csv',
    read_function = \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = filtered_mtcars,
    expr = dplyr::filter(mtcars, am == 1)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_mpg,
    expr = dplyr::select(filtered_mtcars, mpg)
  ) |>
  rixpress()
```

Running `rixpress()` does several things:

- a folder called `_rixpress` gets created in the project's root path. This
  folder contains several files that are generated automatically for the
  pipeline to build successfully;
- a file called `pipeline.nix` gets generated and as you've surely guessed it,
  it's the definition of the whole pipeline in the Nix language;
- finally, the function `rxp_make()` gets also called to actually build the
  pipeline.

However, if you try to run the code above it'll likely fail; this is because
another piece of the puzzle is missing, namely, the environment the pipeline
must run in is missing!

## Defining a reproducible shell for execution

Remember that the whole point of using Nix is that it forces you to be very
thorough when defining derivations by making you declare their dependencies
explicitly. But in the case of the pipeline above, where are these dependencies
defined? Which version of R should be used? And which R packages? The pipeline
uses the function `filter()` and `select()` from the `{dplyr}` package, so we
must declare them. But how? This is where `{rix}` gets used: `{rix}` is a
package that makes it possible to define reproducible development environments
using very simple R code. For example, we could define an environment
with R 4.5.0 and `{dplyr}` like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rix)

rix(
  date = "2025-04-11",
  r_pkgs = "dplyr",
  ide = "rstudio",
  project_path = ".",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

Running this code generates a `default.nix` file that can be built using Nix by
calling `nix-build`, which builds a development environment that contains
RStudio, R and `{dplyr}` as of the 11th of April 2025. This environment can be
used for interactive data analysis like you would if you installed RStudio, R
and `{dplyr}` using the usual installation methods for your operating system. To
learn more about `{rix}`, please visit
[https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/](https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/).

Reproducible development environments generated by `{rix}` are where the
dependencies of the pipelines get defined. In order to use this environment to
build a `{rixpress}` pipeline, you also have to add `{rixpress}` to the list of
packages to install in the environment. Because `{rixpress}` is still being
developed, it must be installed from GitHub. The script to set up the
environment will look like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rix)

# Define execution environment
rix(
  date = "2025-04-11",
  r_pkgs = "dplyr",
  git_pkgs = list(
    package_name = "rixpress",
    repo_url = "https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress",
    commit = "HEAD"
  ),
  ide = "rstudio",
  project_path = ".",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

As explained before, after building this environment using `nix-build` you can
use it to work interactively on your project, but also to set up your
reproducible pipeline using `{rixpress}`.

This is what the script containing the pipeline will look like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rixpress)
# Define pipeline
list(
  rxp_r_file(
    name = mtcars,
    path = 'data/mtcars.csv',
    read_function = \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = filtered_mtcars,
    expr = dplyr::filter(mtcars, am == 1)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_mpg,
    expr = dplyr::select(filtered_mtcars, mpg)
  )
) |>
  rixpress(project_path = ".")
```

This is the setup that we recommend, always have two scripts:

- `gen-env.R` (or similarly named): the script that uses `{rix}` to define the
  execution environment;
- `gen-pipeline.R` (or similarly named): the script that uses `{rixpress}` to
  define the reproducible analytical pipeline.

When executing `gen-pipeline.R` (or its contents, line-by-line), the environment
defined in the `default.nix` gets used (it is also possible to define separate
environments for separate derivations, but this is left for later) and you
should see the following:

```
Build process started...


Build successful! Run `rxp_inspect()` for a summary.
Read individual derivations using `rxp_read()` or
load them into the global environment using `rxp_load()`.
```

You can now follow the instructions, and start by using `rxp_inspect()` which
will show you were the outputs are located. `rxp_inspect()` is especially useful
in case the pipeline fails, to know which derivations failed and which were
successfully built. Then, you can run `rxp_read("mtcars_mpg")` to read this
object in the current interactive session, or `rxp_copy("mtcars_mpg")` to create
a folder called `pipeline-outputs` which will contain `mtcars_mpg` as an `.rds`
file (if you call `rxp_copy()` without arguments, all the outputs of the
pipeline will be copied to this folder).

## DAG representation of the pipeline

Sometimes it might be useful to inspect a graphical representation of the
pipeline as a DAG, a directed acyclic graph. You can inspect the DAG before
building the pipeline by adding the `build = FALSE` argument to `rixpress()`.
This will not build the pipeline, but instead already generate some useful
files, such as a json representation of the pipeline located under
`_rixpress/dag.json`. This should be very quick, and will allow you to visualize
the graph using `plot_dag()`:

<figure>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/refs/heads/master/dag.png" alt="DAG" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">
DAG
</figcaption>
</figure>

(this is the DAG of a slightly more complex example).

It is also possible to instead return the underlying `igraph` object to which
then allows you to plot the DAG using other tools if you prefer, by using
`plot_dag(return_igraph = TRUE)`.

You can then build the pipeline using `rxp_make()` instead of removing
`build = FALSE` from `rixpress()`.

## Conclusion

Now that you know the very basics, we invite to check out the examples
located [here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos). Each of these
examples will teach you about features of `{rixpress}`:

- build a Quarto document;
- polyglot pipelines and how to transfer data between R and Python derivations;
- import many files in one go;
- use multiple environments instead of only one `default.nix` file.
