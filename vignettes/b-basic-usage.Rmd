This vignette demonstrates how to set up a simple pipeline and assumes you've
read `vignette("a-intro-concepts")`.

## Analysing the mtcars dataset using R only

*This pipeline focuses only on R. For multilingual pipelines, see the
`vignette("c-polyglot")` vignette.*

`{rixpress}` provides several functions to help you write derivations. These
functions typically start with the prefix `rxp_` and follow a similar structure.
The first step in any pipeline is usually to import data. To include data in a
`{rixpress}` pipeline, use `rxp_r_file()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d0 <- rxp_r_file(
  name = mtcars,
  path = 'data/mtcars.csv',
  read_function = \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
)
```

`rxp_r_file()` requires an R function with a single argument: the path to the
file to be read. In this example, we assume the columns in the `mtcars.csv` file
are separated by the `|` symbol. We use an anonymous function to set the correct
separator and create a temporary function with a single argument to read the
file at `'data/mtcars.csv'`.

Important: This approach means that the `mtcars.csv` file **will be copied** to
the Nix store. This is essential to how Nix works and cannot be avoided.

Note that `rxp_r_file()` is quite flexible: it works with any function that
reads a file, regardless of the file type.

Once the data is imported, we can start manipulating it. To generate a
derivation similar to the one described in `vignette("a-intro-concepts")`, but
using R and `{dplyr}` instead of `awk`, we would write:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d1 <- rxp_r(
  name = filtered_mtcars,
  expr = dplyr::filter(mtcars, am == 1)
)
```

This syntax should be familiar to users of the `{targets}` package: similar to
the `tar_target()` function, you simply provide a name for the derivation and
the expression to generate it. That's all you need to write for `{rixpress}` to
generate all the required Nix code automatically.

To continue transforming the data, you only need to define a new derivation:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
d2 <- rxp_r(
  name = mtcars_mpg,
  expr = dplyr::select(filtered_mtcars, mpg)
)
```

Notice how the name of `d1` (`filtered_mtcars`) is used in `d2`: this is how
dependencies between derivations are defined.

Let's stop here and build our pipeline. First, we need to define a list of
derivations:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
derivs <- list(d0, d1, d2)
```

and pass it to the `rixpress()` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rixpress(derivs)
```

To make the code more concise, you can directly define the list and pass it to
`rixpress()` using the pipe operator `|>`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rixpress)

list(
  rxp_r_file(
    name = mtcars,
    path = 'data/mtcars.csv',
    read_function = \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = filtered_mtcars,
    expr = dplyr::filter(mtcars, am == 1)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_mpg,
    expr = dplyr::select(filtered_mtcars, mpg)
  )
) |>
  rixpress()
```

Running `rixpress()` performs several actions:

- creates a folder called `_rixpress` in the project's root directory. This
  folder contains automatically generated files needed for the pipeline to build
  successfully.
- generates a file called `pipeline.nix`, which defines the entire pipeline in
  the Nix language.
- calls the function `rxp_make()` to build the pipeline.

However, if you try to run the code above, it will likely fail. This is because
a crucial piece is missing: the environment in which the pipeline must run!

## Defining a Reproducible Shell for Execution

Remember that the core purpose of using Nix is to ensure reproducibility by
forcing you to explicitly declare all dependencies. For our pipeline above, we
need to specify: Which version of R should be used? Which R packages? The
pipeline uses `filter()` and `select()` from the `{dplyr}` package, so we must
declare these dependencies.

This is where the `{rix}` package comes in. `{rix}` allows you to define
reproducible development environments using simple R code. For example, we can
define an environment with R and `{dplyr}` like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rix)

rix(
  date = "2025-04-11",
  r_pkgs = "dplyr",
  ide = "rstudio",
  project_path = ".",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

Running this code generates a `default.nix` file that can be built using Nix by
calling `nix-build`. This creates a development environment containing RStudio,
R, and `{dplyr}` as they existed on April 11, 2025. You can use this environment
for interactive data analysis just as you would with a standard installation of
RStudio, R, and `{dplyr}`. To learn more about `{rix}`, visit
[https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/](https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/).

If you're working on a machine that has Nix installed but doesn't have R or `{rix}`,
you can bootstrap a complete environment with this command:

```
nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rix/main/inst/extdata/default.nix)"
```

This command opens a shell with R and `{rix}` available. Start R by typing `R`
and then run `source("gen-env.R")` to generate the required `default.nix` file.
Next, exit R (with CTRL-D or `quit()`) and exit the shell (with `exit`).
Finally, build the environment by running `nix-build`.

The reproducible development environments generated by `{rix}` define all the
dependencies needed for your pipeline. To use this environment to build a
`{rixpress}` pipeline, you must also add `{rixpress}` to the list of packages in
the environment. Since `{rixpress}` is still under development, it must be
installed from GitHub. Here's how the complete environment setup script looks:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rix)

# Define execution environment
rix(
  date = "2025-04-11",
  r_pkgs = "dplyr",
  git_pkgs = list(
    package_name = "rixpress",
    repo_url = "https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress",
    commit = "HEAD"
  ),
  ide = "rstudio",
  project_path = ".",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

After building this environment with `nix-build`, you can use it both for
interactive work on your project and for setting up your reproducible pipeline
with `{rixpress}`.

Here's what the pipeline script looks like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(rixpress)
# Define pipeline
list(
  rxp_r_file(
    name = mtcars,
    path = 'data/mtcars.csv',
    read_function = \(x) (read.csv(file = x, sep = "|"))
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = filtered_mtcars,
    expr = dplyr::filter(mtcars, am == 1)
  ),

  rxp_r(
    name = mtcars_mpg,
    expr = dplyr::select(filtered_mtcars, mpg)
  )
) |>
  rixpress(project_path = ".")
```

I recommend always using two separate scripts:

- `gen-env.R`: Uses `{rix}` to define the execution environment
- `gen-pipeline.R`: Uses `{rixpress}` to define the reproducible analytical pipeline

You can quickly create these scripts using the `rxp_init()` function, which
generates both files with starter code to help you get started quickly.

When you run `gen-pipeline.R` (or execute its contents line-by-line), the
environment defined in `default.nix` is used. (It's also possible to define
separate environments for different derivations, which we'll cover in a later
vignette.) Upon successful execution, you should see:

```
Build process started...


Build successful! Run `rxp_inspect()` for a summary.
Read individual derivations using `rxp_read()` or
load them into the global environment using `rxp_load()`.
```

Now you can follow these instructions:

1. Use `rxp_inspect()` to see where the outputs are located. This function is
   particularly useful if the pipeline fails, as it shows which derivations
   succeeded and which failed.
2. Use `rxp_read("mtcars_mpg")` to read the object into your current R session,
   or `rxp_load("mtcars_mpg")` to load it directly into your global environment.
3. Alternatively, use `rxp_copy("mtcars_mpg")` to create a folder called
   `pipeline-outputs` containing `mtcars_mpg` as an `.rds` file. If you call
   `rxp_copy()` without arguments, all pipeline outputs will be copied to this
   folder.

## DAG Representation of the Pipeline

It's often helpful to visualize your pipeline as a DAG (directed acyclic graph).
You can generate and inspect this visualization before building the pipeline by
adding the `build = FALSE` argument to `rixpress()`:

```r
rixpress(derivs, build = FALSE)
```

This won't build the pipeline but will generate useful files, including a JSON
representation of the pipeline at `_rixpress/dag.json`. This process is quick
and allows you to visualize the graph using `rxp_visnetwork()`, which opens
a new tab in your web browser with the DAG of the pipeline made using the
`{visNetwork}` package:

  <source
    src="https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/raw/refs/heads/main/rxp_visnetwork.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  <!-- Fallback message -->
  Your browser does not support the MP4 video format.
</video>

(This image shows the DAG of a more complex example pipeline.)

For static documents, you can use `rxp_ggdag()` which uses `{ggdag}` under
the hood:

<figure>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress/refs/heads/main/dag.png" alt="DAG" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">DAG</figcaption>
</figure>

You can also return the underlying `igraph` object to plot the DAG using other
tools:

```r
dag_for_ci()
```

which saves the `dag.dot` object in the project's `_rixpress/` folder.

After reviewing the DAG, you can build the pipeline by running `rxp_make()`
instead of modifying your original `rixpress()` call.

## Conclusion

Now that you understand the basics, we invite you to explore the examples
located in the [rixpress_demos
repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos). These examples
demonstrate additional features of `{rixpress}`, including:

- Building Quarto documents
- Creating polyglot pipelines that transfer data between R and Python
- Importing multiple files at once
- Using multiple environments instead of a single `default.nix` file

For a more detailed walkthrough, check out our [video tutorial](video link to
follow).

In the next vignette, `vignette("c-polyglot")`, we'll explore how to create
pipelines that combine R and Python code.
