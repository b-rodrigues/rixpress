# Contributing

## Development environment

We provide a `default.nix` file that defines the right development environment
if you already are a Nix user and wish to contribute to the package. This
development environment will provide the required R packages to allow you to
work on `{rixpress}`. This development environment is pinned to a specific `nixpkgs`
commit, so it does not reflect the current status on CRAN. This is why it's also
important to make sure that contributions work on `rhub`.

## Submitting PRs

PRs are very welcome, just make sure unit tests pass if you open one. If you
still want feedback but tests don’t pass, then set the PR to draft.

If you’ve added a feature, make sure to document it and add a corresponding unit
test as well.

We don't mind PRs with code generated by LLMs, but be mindful of the following:

- make sure you understand and are happy to be responsible for every line of
  code as if you had written it yourself;
- make sure the code uses a similar coding style (for example, we don’t use
  global veriables);
- LLMs sometimes generate very verbose code to achieve simple things, try to
  simplify the code as much as possible.
