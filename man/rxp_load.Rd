\title{Load output of a derivation}
\usage{
rxp_load(derivation_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{derivation_name}{Character, the name of the derivation.}
}
\value{
Nothing, this function has the side effect of loading
objects into the global environment.
}
\description{
Loads the output of derivations in the global environment
of the current session, returns a path if reading directly is not possible.
}
\details{
When \code{derivation_name} points to a single R object,
it gets loaded in the current session using
\code{assign(..., envir = .GlobalEnv)}.
If itâ€™s a Python object and {reticulate} is available,
\code{reticulate::py_load_object()} is used and then the object
gets loaded into the golbal environment. In case
the derivation is pointing to several outputs (which can
happen when building a Quarto document for example) or
loading fails, the path to the object is returned instead.

\dontrun{
  rxp_load("mtcars")
