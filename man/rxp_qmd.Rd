}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Symbol, derivation name.}

\item{qmd_file}{Character, path to .qmd file.}

\item{additional_files}{Character vector, additional files to include, for
example a folder containing images to include in the Quarto document.}

\item{nix_env}{Character, path to the Nix environment file, default is
"default.nix".}

\item{args}{A character of additional arguments to be passed directly to the

\item{env_var}{List, defaults to NULL. A named list of environment variables
to set before running the Quarto render command, e.g., c(QUARTO_PROFILE =
"production"). Each entry will be added as an export statement in the build
phase.}
}
\value{
An object of class derivation which inherits from lists.

\description{
Render a Quarto document as a Nix derivation
}
\details{
To include built derivations in the document,
\code{rxp_read("derivation_name")} should be put in the .qmd file.

\dontrun{
  # Compile a .qmd file to a pdf using typst
  # `images` is a folder containing images to include in the Quarto doc
